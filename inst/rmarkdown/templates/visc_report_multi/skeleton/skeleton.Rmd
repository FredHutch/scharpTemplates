# Notes on Using PDF and Word Output Template

 - Use the Knit button select either the PDF (visc_report) or Word (word_document2) output.
   - Note the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-K will run the first output in the YAML, will be the last output run (starts off as PDF first)
   - If you want to run both report in one command, either use `rmarkdown::render()` with `output_format = 'all'`, or install the loom package and create a RStudio Addin (<https://github.com/thebioengineer/loom>).
 - For pagebreaks use the `visc_clearpage()` funtion. You can use this as a simple inline code.
   - `\clearpage` will not work on Word output
 - For figure and table references use `visc_ref()` function (see examples). 
   - Make sure chunk names only use dashes or refering will not work (no spaces or underscores)
   - Do not use figure or table labels in chunk headings or kable code. Rmarkdown will automatically assign the chunk name as the figure/table reference label
 - For referencing papers, simply use the @ symbol before bib file reference (i.e. `@Huang:2013fl` gives: @Huang:2013fl)
 - For referencing sections, use `[Section header text]` in the text
   - `[Background]` gives: [Background]
   - `[Biological endpoints]` gives: [Biological endpoints]
 - Tables:
   - Only output one table per code chunk
   - Make sure to have `format = output_type` in the `kableExtra::kable()` call 
     - `output_type` is either "latex" or "pandoc" depending on current report output
   - Table name will be chunk name plus "tab:" 
     - i.e. if chunk name is "descriptvie-stats" then the table label will be "tab:descriptvie-stats"
   - Note Word output cannot support many kableExtra features, such as `kableExtra::kable_styling()`
     - set `warning=kable_warnings` chunk option, otherwise Word output will have unwanted warnings
 - Figures:
   - Only output one figure per code chunk
   - Figure name will be chunk name plus "fig:" 
     - i.e. if chunk name is "descriptvie-stats" then the table label will be "fig:descriptvie-stats"
 - P values:
   - When using `VISCfunctions::pretty_pvalues()` make sure to use `output_type = output_type`,  `bold  = pandoc_markup`, and ,  `italic = pandoc_markup`
     - This will give the appropriate markup depending on PDF or Word output


# Summary of Main Results

Summarize the findings of the report. Include specific comparisons and references to corresponding figures and tables.


# Background

Outline the study schema/schedule, study groups, time points, etc. Background information can be found on ATLAS or in the study protocol, and the background section is also included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and QC report.

Add Study Schedule Table and Specimen Schedule Table in this section

# Objectives

List primary and secondary (if applicable) objectives. Objectives can be found on ATLAS, in the study protocol, or in the SAP, and should be adjusted if necessary to accommodate available data.

# Endpoints

## Biological endpoints

Describe the lab measures of interest and the antigens/isolates tested. Information for this section can be found in the SAP, but the tense should be changed from future tense to past tense for PT reports. Most citations used are included in the bibliography.bib file at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/scharpTemplates/tree/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/visc_report/skeleton. Testing Reference: @Huang:2013fl.

## Statistical endpoints

Describe the statistical measures of interest (response, response magnitude, etc.) including response call methodology and truncation, if applicable. Assay-specific statistical endpoint information can be found at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs.

# Lab Methods

Describe the lab methods and sample inclusion criteria. Assay-specific information can be found on Github at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs/tree/master/Lab_Methods. This section may also be already included in the SAP, but verbs should be changed from future to past tense.

# Statistical Methods

## Graphical analysis

Update the following section as appropriate for your data.

Response rates were plotted, with accompanying Wilson score confidence intervals, for each group, antigen, and study time point. Distributions of response magnitude were plotted on the log scale for each group, antigen, and study time point with box plots superimposed on the distribution of responders. The mid-line of the box denotes the median and the ends of the box denote the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). To show response trend over time, line plots of response magnitude were plotted on the log scale by study group and antigen across time points.

## Statistical tests

Update the following section as appropriate for your data. Assay-specific testing inclusion criteria can be found at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs.  

To assess if two groups have different response rates, pairwise group comparisons were conducted using Fisher’s exact test for each time point and antigen. For comparisons across time, McNemar's test were used to account for paired data. Response magnitude comparisons between experimental groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test among responders only. Response magnitude comparisons between time points were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to account for paired data. To be included in the time point comparisons, a participant must be a responder in at least one of the time points. 

The Wilcoxon tests are rank-based tests used to account for non-normality in the magnitude measurements. Because response magnitude comparisons were performed on responders only, each group must have at least 3 responders for the comparison to be conducted. 

# Participant Cohort

Summarize the data by antigen/isolate, time point, and study group. Discuss expected vs. observed sample size. Consider including a summary table.

# Results

Summarize the statistical analyses performed.

## Section 1

Consider breaking up the results section by objective or by statistical endpoint.

## Section 2

Make sure to include p-values and references to relevant tables and figures. See Figure `r visc_ref('fig:example-plot')` and Table `r visc_ref('tab:example-tab')`.
